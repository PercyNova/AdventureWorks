# Northwind SQL Analysis

This project demonstrates SQL analysis and reporting using the **Northwind** dataset. The tasks range from basic querying to advanced analysis, simulating real-world scenarios that a data analyst might encounter.

## Dataset
- **Name**: Northwind
- **Source**: [Microsoft Northwind Sample Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/northwind-sample-database)
- **Description**: A fictional company's database, including sales, inventory, customers, and suppliers, often used for practicing SQL queries.

## Project Objective
The goal is to:
1. Practice SQL querying and analysis using the Northwind database.
2. Extract meaningful insights to assist business decision-making.
3. Create reports and dashboards to showcase findings from the data.

## How to Replicate
1. Download the Northwind database from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/northwind-sample-database).
2. Restore the database on your SQL Server (or use a cloud SQL platform such as Azure SQL Database).
3. Run the SQL scripts provided in the `sql/` folder to perform the analysis.

## Results and Insights
1. **Monthly Revenue Trends**: Sales peaked in Q4 due to seasonal promotions and holiday-related purchases.
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Customers from Region Y spend significantly more than the average.
3. **Inventory Management**: Product A is running low on stock, and orders need to be placed soon to avoid stockouts.
4. **Employee Performance**: Employees handling larger sales orders tend to generate higher revenue.
